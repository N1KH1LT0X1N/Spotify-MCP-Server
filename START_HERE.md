## üéØ Test It Out

Once setup, ask Claude (or test directly):

**Playback:**

- "Play Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen"
- "Skip to the next song"

**Discovery:**
- "Search for playlists about jazz"
- "Give me recommendations based on chill music"

- "Save this track to my library"

**Playlists:**
- "Create a playlist called 'AI Picks'"

## ‚ö° Quick Commands

```bash

```

## üÜò Need Help?

1. **Setup issues?** ‚Üí Run `python verify_setup.py`
2. **Auth problems?** ‚Üí Run `python test_auth.py` to test standalone
3. **"No module named 'spotify_mcp'"?** ‚Üí Set PYTHONPATH to the `src` directory
4. **"ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"?** ‚Üí This is normal! Copy the URL from your browser
5. **Other issues?** ‚Üí Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Common Gotchas We Fixed

‚úÖ **Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`** - Spotify requires explicit IPv4  
‚úÖ **Set PYTHONPATH** - Point to the `src` directory  
‚úÖ **Authentication to stderr** - Prevents JSON-RPC conflicts  
‚úÖ **Smart .env finding** - Searches parent directories automatically  

All issues documented in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)!

## üéâ What's Next?

After you have it running:

1. **Use it!** Try all the different tools
2. **Explore** what you can build with 22 tools
3. **Contribute** Phase 2 features (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
4. **Share** your experience and improvements

## üìä By The Numbers

- **22 tools** ready to use
- **6 categories** of functionality  
- **2,500+ lines** of production code
- **~5 minutes** to full setup
- **0 bugs** known (fresh build!)

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Premium Required:** Playback control needs Spotify Premium
2. **Batch Operations:** Most tools support adding/removing up to 50-100 items at once
3. **Pagination:** Results include `has_more` - use offset to get more
4. **URIs vs IDs:** Tools accept both - they auto-convert
