"""Audiobook management tools for Spotify.

DEPRECATED: Audiobook functionality is not available for development mode applications.
The Spotify Web API requires Extended Quota Mode (approved production apps) for audiobook access.
Additionally, the spotipy library is missing several audiobook methods.

This module is kept as a placeholder for potential future functionality if/when:
1. The app is approved for Extended Quota Mode
2. The spotipy library adds full audiobook support
