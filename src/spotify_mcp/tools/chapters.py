Chapter tools for Spotify MCP server.

DEPRECATED: Chapter functionality is not fully available because:
1. The spotipy library is missing the `chapter()` and `chapters()` methods
2. Chapter endpoints are related to audiobooks which require Extended Quota Mode

This module is kept as a placeholder for potential future functionality if/when:
1. The spotipy library adds chapter methods
2. The app is approved for Extended Quota Mode
